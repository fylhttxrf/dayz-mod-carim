[h2]Autorun[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides autorunning functionality. Start and stop using the configurable key (default: '+'). Adjust the running speed using your normal keybinds.

[h2]Chat[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides global chat. Switch chat channels with the press of a configurable key (default: 'Z'). Adjust size with configurable keys (up: ']', down: '[').

[h2]Compass[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides a compass at the top of the display with the press of a configurable key (default: 'H').

[h2]Map[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides an in-game map for saving markers and viewing party members. Open with the vanilla configurable key (default: 'M'). Double-click to add a marker, double-right-click to edit and remove.

To apply a nicer style than vanilla with additional locations, you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3483791557]the CarimMapStyle mod[/url].

[h2]Nametags[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides ability to configure zones to display player nametags by specifying a position and radius.

[h2]Party[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Allows creation of parties and displaying of nametags of party members. There is no party size limit.

Parties are managed by the player. Open the menu (default key: 'P'), and Add players to your party. If they have also added you, then your nametags will automatically appear. Parties are saved, so you don't have to re-create it each time you login. They also work for whatever server runs the mod.

Tactical pings can be placed (default key: 'T', clear with 'Y') that will be shared with your party.

Optionally, servers can configure Admin Ids that allow adding party members without them needing to add back.
