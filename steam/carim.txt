[h2]Autorun[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides autorunning functionality. Start and stop using the configurable key (default: '+'). Adjust the running speed using your normal keybinds.

[h2]Chat[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides global chat. Switch chat channels with the press of a configurable key (default: 'Z'). Adjust size with configurable keys (up: ']', down: '[').

If you have an admin tool that disallows non-ascii characters, you need to allowlist the following: [code]ᐅ[/code]
For Battleye BEC, go to Config.cfg in the battleye/Bec folder and change IgnoreChatChars to [code]IgnoreChatChars = €,£,æ,Æ,ø,Ø,å,Å,ö,ä,ü,ß,ᐅ[/code]

[h2]Compass[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides a compass at the top of the display with the press of a configurable key (default: 'H').

[h2]Map[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides an in-game map for saving markers and viewing party members. Open with the vanilla configurable key (default: 'M'). Double-click to add a marker, double-right-click to edit and remove.

To apply a nicer style than vanilla with additional locations, you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3483791557]the CarimMapStyle mod[/url].

[h2]Party[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Allows creation of parties and displaying of nametags of party members. There is no party size limit.

Parties are managed by the player. Open the menu (default key: 'P'), and Add players to your party. If they have also added you, then your nametags will automatically appear. Parties are saved, so you don't have to re-create it each time you login. They also work for whatever server runs the mod.

Tactical pings can be placed (default key: 'T', clear with 'Y') that will be shared with your party.

Optionally, servers can configure Admin Ids that allow adding party members without them needing to add back.

[h2]Configuration[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Configuration is managed in your cfggameplay.json. Different modules can be enabled/disabled independently. The defaults are below (copy these into your cfggameplay.json and change as you want). You only need to add the values if you want to change from the defaults.

Be sure to enable the use of this config file in your serverDZ.cfg with
[code]enableCfgGameplayFile=1;[/code]

Put them in your cfggameplay.json at the top level, like
[code]
{
    "version": 122,
    "GeneralData": {
        ...
    },
    "PlayerData": {
        ...
    },
    "CarimData": {
        ...
    },
    ...
}
[/code]
