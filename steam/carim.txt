[h2]Chat[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides global chat. Switch chat channels with the press of a configurable key (default: 'Z'). Adjust size with configurable keys (up: ']', down: '[').

If you have an admin tool that disallows non-ascii characters, you need to allowlist the following: [code]ᐅ[/code]
For Battleye BEC, go to Config.cfg in the battleye/Bec folder and change IgnoreChatChars to [code]IgnoreChatChars = €,£,æ,Æ,ø,Ø,å,Å,ö,ä,ü,ß,ᐅ[/code]

[h2]Compass[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides a compass at the top of the display with the press of a configurable key (default: 'H').

[h2]Map[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Provides an in-game map for saving markers and viewing party members. Open with the vanilla configurable key (default: 'M'). Double-click to add a marker, double-right-click to remove.

[h2]Party[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Allows creation of parties and displaying of nametags of party members. There is no party size limit.

Parties are managed by the player. Open the menu (default key: 'P'), and Add players to your party. If they have also added you, then your nametags will automatically appear. Parties are saved, so you don't have to re-create it each time you login. They also work for whatever server runs the mod.

Tactical pings can be placed (default key: 'T', clear with 'Y') that will be shared with your party.

Optionally, servers can configure Admin Ids that allow adding party members without them needing to add back.

[h2]Configuration[/h2]
[hr][/hr]
Configuration is managed in your cfggameplay.json. Different modules can be enabled/disabled independently. The defaults are below (copy these into your cfggameplay.json and change as you want).
[code]
"CarimData": {
    "adminIds" = [],
    "CarimAutorunData": {
        "enabled": true
    },
    "CarimChatData": {
        "enabled": true,
        "colorDirect": 0xfffafafa,
        "colorGlobal": 0xffffd54f,
        "colorServer": 0xff4fc3f7,
        "colorAlert": 0xffff8a65
    },
    "CarimCompassData": {
        "enabled": true
    },
    "CarimMapData": {
        "enabled": true
    },
    "CarimPartyData": {
        "enabled": true,
        "maxPartySize": -1,
        "maxPings": 3
    }
},
[/code]

To enable the map without needing any items, you can edit those existing settings to
[code]
"MapData": {
    "ignoreMapOwnership": true,
    "ignoreNavItemsOwnership": true,
    "displayPlayerPosition": true,
    "displayNavInfo": true
},
[/code]
